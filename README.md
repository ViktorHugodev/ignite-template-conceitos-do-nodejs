# NodeJs Challenge 01

### About the challenge


In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in Node.js!

This will be an application to manage tasks (in English *all*). It will be allowed the creation of a user with a `name` and `username`, as well as doing the CRUD of *everyone*:

- Create a new *todo*;
- List all *all*;
- Change the `title` and `deadline` of an existing *whole*;
- Mark a *whole* as done;
- Delete a *whole*;

All this for each specific user (the `username` will be passed through the header). Next, we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€
